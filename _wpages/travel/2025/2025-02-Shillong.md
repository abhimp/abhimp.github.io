We planned our honeymoon to [Shilong] and nearby areas. Landed at Shilong airport and started towards [Shilong] city. The path to city pass through the magnificant [Umiam Lake]. It was pretty late. So, we stayed at the hotel and visited the local market.

### Day 1
On the day 1, we started our sight seeing with the Cathedral. It is a church. A simple church on a sunny morning.
We took few photos.

### Day 2
While our day 1 was amazing, it become more amazing on the day 2. After a quick breakfast we headed for the CherraPunjee. However, we visited many beautiful places.

Our first stop was a view point Dympep Waterfalls. Although there was no water fall visible at the spot, the view was mesomirzing.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/LyngksiarFalls-07.jpg" alt="Panaromic view at the entrance towards the Falls" %}

The Lyngksiar Falls also have few caves. We went there, however, photos are not good.

Next we headed towards the Garden of caves. It has about 12 caves. Some of them are very dangerous. We enjoyed a lot at the garden. I am going to post few selected photos only.

After a long breakfast we roam around the place a bit. Then we headed for our journey towards Dawkie. Our first destination is Mawlynnong Living Root Bridge.

So, we waited for sometime and Sun rose behind.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Camping-05.jpg" alt="Our little bon-fire at the campsite" %}

After Krangsuri Falls, We headed for Tyrshi Falls. Tyrshi Falls have multiple steps. At the final steps, it remind me the scene from Bollywood movie Bahubali.
