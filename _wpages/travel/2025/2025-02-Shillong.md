## Honeymoon to Shillong
22-February-2025

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Banner-01.jpg" alt="The Magnificent Umiam Lake" %}

We planned our honeymoon to [Shillong] and nearby areas. We landed at Shillong airport and started towards [Shillong] city. The path to the city passes through the magnificent [Umiam Lake]. It was pretty late, so we stayed at the hotel and visited the local market.

### Day 1
On Day 1, we started our sightseeing with the [Cathedral]. It is a church. A simple church on a sunny morning.
We took a few photos.

Next, we went to [Shillong View Point]. We could see the entire Shillong from here. The place was awesome.

After the viewpoint, we were off to the Army Museum followed by [Elephant Falls] and [Ward's Lake].

### Day 2
While Day 1 was amazing, it became more amazing on Day 2. After a quick breakfast, we headed for [Cherrapunjee]. We visited many beautiful places along the way.

Our first stop was the [Dympep Waterfalls] viewpoint. Although there was no waterfall visible at the spot, the view was mesmerizing.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/Dympep-03.jpg" alt="Dympep Waterfalls View Point" %}

On the way, we found another awesome unmarked viewpoint. I stopped and took photos.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/ADViewPoint-03.jpg" alt="Some awesome place" %}

Our next stop was more amazing and totally unexplored. On our way, we saw a mound with cave holes. It looked like the following.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/MoundCave-02.jpg" alt="Mound Cave Entrance" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/MoundCave-04.jpg" alt="View from the cave top" %}


After spending some time and shooting a lot of photos at the cave, we headed towards [Lyngksiar Falls]. The water at the falls was pristine and chilly.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/LyngksiarFalls-01.jpg" alt="First view of the Lyngksiar Falls" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/LyngksiarFalls-02.jpg" alt="Looks like there is no water falling from the falls" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/LyngksiarFalls-03.jpg" alt="However, the real view was at the bottom of the lake" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/LyngksiarFalls-04.jpg" alt="Multistep falls" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/LyngksiarFalls-05.jpg" alt="Water is so clean" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/LyngksiarFalls-06.jpg" alt="..." %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/LyngksiarFalls-07.jpg" alt="Panoramic view at the entrance towards the Falls" %}

Lyngksiar Falls also has a few caves. We went there; however, the photos were not good.

Next, we headed towards the [Garden of Caves]. It has about 12 caves. Some of them are very dangerous. We enjoyed ourselves a lot at the garden. I am going to post only a few selected photos.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/CaveGarden-02.jpg" alt="Selected photos from Garden of Caves" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/CaveGarden-03.jpg" alt="Eternal life-line" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/CaveGarden-04.jpg" alt="Another cave falls" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/CaveGarden-05.jpg" alt="Same falls from distance" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/CaveGarden-06.jpg" alt="The bamboo bridge" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/CaveGarden-07.jpg" alt="Eternal drop of water" %}


While we were heading towards our next destination, [Nohkalikai Falls], we saw our resort from the opposite valley. We just took a photo there.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/SamaikaFirstView-01.jpg" alt="First view of the our resort" %}

At that time, we also saw that the sun was about to set behind the hill.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/SunSetOnWay-01.jpg" alt="Sun is setting behind the hill" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/SunSetOnWay-02.jpg" alt="Sun is setting behind the hill" %}

By the time we reached [Nohkalikai Falls] View Point, it was already dusk. So, most of the photos are hazy.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/Nohkalikai-01.jpg" alt="The Nohkalikai Falls" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day2/Nohkalikai-02.jpg" alt="The Nohkalikai Falls" %}

We started towards our resort soon. When we reached it, it was already night. Our tour planner arranged an awesome room for us. It was an individual cottage with a single bedroom larger than my home. As it was late, we took all our photos the next day.

### Day 3

After a long breakfast, we roamed around the place a bit. Then we headed for our journey towards [Dawki]. Our first destination was [Mawlynnong] [Living Root Bridge].

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/Saimaika-01.jpg" alt="Our cottage at the resort" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/Saimaika-02.jpg" alt="View from the balcony" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/Saimaika-03.jpg" alt="Leaving the resort" %}

On the way, we found an awesome landscape.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/OnTheWay-01.jpg" alt="Awesome View" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/OnTheWay-02.jpg" alt="Awesome View" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/OnTheWay-03.jpg" alt="Awesome View" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/OnTheWay-04.jpg" alt="Awesome View" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/OnTheWay-05.jpg" alt="Awesome View" %}

Finally, we reached [Mawlynnong] [Living Root Bridge]. While I had visited this place before, it was the first visit for my wife.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/Mawlynnong-01.jpg" alt="Mawlynnong living root bridge" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/Mawlynnong-02.jpg" alt="Mawlynnong living root bridge" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/Mawlynnong-04.jpg" alt="Mawlynnong living root bridge" %}


After the [Living Root Bridge], we visited the cleanest village briefly and headed for [Dawki].

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/Dawki-01.jpg" alt="The Dawki River" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/Dawki-02.jpg" alt="The Dawki River" %}

It was already very late. We quickly visited the border and moved to our camping site.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day3/Camping-02.jpg" alt="Our little bon-fire at the campsite" %}

### Day 4

The next day, I woke up early and went out towards the stream. While daylight was already here, the sun had not yet risen. So, we sat for some time.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Camping-03.jpg" alt="Our little bon-fire at the campsite" %}

So, we waited for some time and the sun rose.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Camping-04.jpg" alt="Our little bon-fire at the campsite" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Camping-05.jpg" alt="Our little bon-fire at the campsite" %}

Soon, we left the campsite to start our Day 4 adventure and return to Shillong. However, there was a cable bridge at the camping site, and it was worth a visit.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Camping-07.jpg" alt="View from the cable bridge." %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Camping-08.jpg" alt="View from the cable bridge. All the campers are preparing to leave the place" %}


We said goodbye to the camping site and headed towards [Krangsuri Falls]. It is one of my favorite waterfalls.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Krangsuri-01.jpg" alt="The Krangsuri falls." %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Krangsuri-02.jpg" alt="The Krangsuri falls." %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Krangsuri-03.jpg" alt="The Krangsuri falls." %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Krangsuri-04.jpg" alt="At the top of the Krangsuri falls." %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Krangsuri-05.jpg" alt="Another view of the same Krangsuri falls." %}

After [Krangsuri Falls], we headed for [Tyrshi Falls]. Tyrshi Falls has multiple steps. At the final steps, it reminded me of a scene from the Bollywood movie Bahubali.

At the top, we found a simple waterfall which was awesome in its own right.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Tyrshi-01.jpg" alt="The begining of Tyrshi falls." %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Tyrshi-02.jpg" alt="The begining of Tyrshi falls." %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Tyrshi-04.jpg" alt="The begining of Tyrshi falls." %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Tyrshi-03.jpg" alt="The valley after the Tyrshi falls." %}

Once we finished our tour at the top, we went down to view the magnificence of the great Tyrshi Falls.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="day4/Tyrshi-05.jpg" alt="The entire falls." %}

{% include function_travelyt.html yt="3zqxvrA-b6M" %}

It was a long journey to the top. However it was filled with joy.

This was the end of our trip. We quickly reached Shillong and started for home the next day.
