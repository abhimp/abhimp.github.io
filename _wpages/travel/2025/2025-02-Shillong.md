We planned our honeymoon to [Shilong] and nearby areas. Landed at Shilong airport and started towards [Shilong] city. The path to city pass through the magnificant [Umiam Lake]. It was pretty late. So, we stayed at the hotel and visited the local market.

### Day 1
On the day 1, we started our sight seeing with the Cathedral. It is a church. A simple church on a sunny morning.
We took few photos.
