## Start

We started reached NJP via train arround 7:30 in the Morning of 28th January. It was pretty easy find a commute anywhere from there. There several options available including bus, shuttle and reserved taxy/cab. We found a reserved cab with reasonable fare of Rs. 3K to Maneybhanjan. It was approximately 90KM and took around 4hrs.

Maneybhanjan is place to start trekking among many others. First thing was to find a place stay there for the night and find a guide. It was pretty easy as there there are many homestays and hotels and it was a off-season. We found a reasonable homestay Druk Homestay for Rs. 1k per head for fooding and lodging. They also found us a guide. It was 11:30am. So, freshen up a bit and have our lunch by 12:30pm.

We had plenty of time. So we started roaming around and site seeing by walking. It is a small but complete town. It also have a SBI ATM.

## Day 1

Next Morning we started for trekking around 8:30am in the morning. We needed to perform few formalities. However it was handled by our guide only.

The trek from Maneybhanjan starts with very stiff stairs. It continues for approximately 1KM. We reached Chitre monestry which is 3KM from Maneybhanjan in one and half hour. 0The route is mostly dense forest. There is a cafe at Chitre. We had tea there.

After Chitre, the route goes through open space. So it is pleasant to walk. Next stop was at Lamudhyuri which is 3KM from Chitre.

Next stop was at Meghma, another 3KM from Lamudhyuri. It is a small village of population 30. We had lunch at a very friendly hotel. Food was good and the owner was telling lot off stories about the locality.

We went to Tumling from Meghma via a shortcut. It was 2KM. We saw **water powered Buddhists Payer Wheel**. At the Tumling, our guide find us a really great hotel at very reasonable price just beside the sunset point. They provided good food. In the evening, they arranged a small smoldering fire pit to make us comfortable. They also provided free WiFi for us.

At Tumling, we saw the [Kangchenjunga][kanchen] and sleeping buddha for the first time during the sunset. The view was spectacular. It is hard to explain beauty. And picture does not do justice.


## Day 2

On day 2, we start for Kalaphokhri around 9AM. We reached gairibas in 3hrs. This was a downhill trek for 6KM. There were lot of greenery on the route.

After gairibas, there were 2KM extreme uphill trek to reach kaiyakata.

We reached Kalaphokhri around 4PM. It was a 6KM moderate trek. Although guide said it was 4KM, little investigation in Google map revealed that it was 6KM.

Kalaphokhri is famous for the lake. However I did not find it interesting.

## Day 3

We left Kalaphokhri on 31st of January for our destination Sandakfu. Sandakfu was visible from Kalaphokhri.

Trek to Sandakfu was short but very stiff. We had to climb almost 400m in 6KM. Till Bekaybhanjan it was almost flat for 2KM. Stiffness starts just after Bekaybhanjan and it grows as we goes near Sadakfu.

We reached Sandakfu around 2:30PM. Sandakfu is pretty empty. It basically have two place to stay, one is GTA accodation on the India side and Sunrise Hotel on the Nepal side. A road constructed by the Indian Govt. is the border between two countries. GTA accomodation does not have electricity or Internet connection. However, sunrise hotel does have those thing. Our guide had plan to go down another kilometer. However, we find the Hotel Sunrise better to stay. We got a very good room with view of [Kangchenjunga][kanchen] pick. This room also had view for Mount Everest, however it was blocked by a tree.

We settled in the room around 4:30PM when sunset started. Kangchenjunga was looking too pretty at this time. While we were planning to watch sunset from the room, our guide told us about the nearby hill top view point. So we rushed there. It was almost dark. However, it had the 360 degree view of the surroundings.

Next morning we watch the sunrise from the roof of our hotel and then went to the hill again. This time we watch both the mount everest and the mount Kangchenjunga. Here goes the peeks.
