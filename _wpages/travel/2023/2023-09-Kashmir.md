The [Kashmir][kashmirwiki] is one the most popular tourist destination in India. It is situated in the [Uninon Territory of Jammu and Kashmir][utjk]

I went there after my Dubai Summit along with my parents and my sister. The trip starts from Srinagar and ends with Srinagar. We reached Srinagar pretty late on 29th September. We booked a packaged tour for our trip. So, our driver was waiting at Srinagar Airport for us and he directly took us to the hotel. We stayed srinagar for 4days. Our day 1 starts from 30th September.

### Day 1: Local sight seeing at Srinagar

We started the Day 1 visiting [Shankaracharya Temple][temple]. Our driver took us to the temple base and we had to climb approximately 250 stair cases. It is a typical hindu temple on a hill top. The environment have the desired piousness. Apartfrom this, one can get a great view of Srinagar from this place. I also got fantastic view of the [Jhelum River][jhriver] and the [Dal Lake][dallake]. However, could not capture the best view due to fog.

The Srinagar city also called city of gardens as it have many beautiful gardens. We visited few of them namely [Parimahal][parimahal], [Chashma Shahi Garden][chashmashahi], [Shalimar Bagh Mughal Garden][shalimargarden] and [Nishat Garden][nishatgarden].

Parimahal is multi-level garden on a mountain slope. The entire garden is filled with followers.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Pari-04.jpg" alt="Parimahal" %}

Chashma Shahi is not that big but nice and compact. Just beside the raj bhaban or something so cell reception is bad.

After having a quick lunch, we visited the Shalimar Bagh. It was underconstruction, otherwise it is supposed to filled with fountains and flowers.

The Nishat Garden is the biggest among all these garden. We had to probably walk for a kilometer to reach the other end. But overall nice a fantastic. It have active fountains in a line for the entire run. Although you can not see all of them from the back partly because its too big and mostly because of the elevation. However, this is a must go as per opinion.

### Day 2: Visit to Sonemarg, Zero point

Next day, we started for Sonemarg, zero point. It is around 60KM from Srinagar. The road is pretty good. Infact the road goes all the way to kargil. Anyway, the rental cars are not allowed to go beyond Sonemarg due to local policy. Then one have bargain and pay 4-6 times of original price for a trip to Zero point. They local drivers and people are extremely impolite and rude. Behaviour made the experience extremely bad. However, found few good views while on the way to zero point.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="WayToZeroPoint-13.jpg" alt="Way to Zero Point" %}


At zeropoint things were really good. We just spent the time and everything was absolutely okay until the driver came shouted on us for taking extra time (which was a lie).

At the end of the day, we returned back to Srinagar.

### Day 3: Trip to Doodhpathri

On the Monday, we went to Doodhpathri. It is supposed to be a place where water look like white milk. However, locals don't allow cars to go to the actual place. And one have to take pony or ATVs. Driver also did not tell us that it is not that far. One can easily walk, instead they told us that it is 12KM while it is only a KM and mostly paved road. Anyway, we took pony and went through some a field. Got few very good photos.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Dudh-15.jpg" alt="Dudhpathri" %}

The Doodhpathri it self is pretty good. One should walk there as far as one can.

### Day 4: The Gondolaride

Next morning, we checkout from our hotel and move to gulmarg. Gulmarg is infested with local policies against tourist. They don't even allow to tourist to enter the town with there own car without hotel booking. The gondola ride is almost 2KM from the town entrance. So, one have to take expensive local pony or ATVs. Apart from these, gulmarg is really nice place to be. It have a vast green valley.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Gulmarg-01.jpg" alt="Gulmarg" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Gulmarg-06.jpg" alt="Gulmarg" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Gulmarg-07.jpg" alt="Gulmarg" %}

We first checked in the hotel, freshen up a bit then went to Gondola, which was pretty close to our hotel. The ride was really awesome.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Gondola-02.jpg" alt="Gondola" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Gondola-06.jpg" alt="Gondola" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Gondola-07.jpg" alt="Gondola" %}

It was around 7min ride to the 1 phase after a 20min waiting in the queue. Phase I was awesome. Phase II and chair lift was closed at the time. However, we enjoyed the valley. It was really peacefull.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="GondolaHill-02.jpg" alt="GondolaHill" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="GondolaHill-03.jpg" alt="GondolaHill" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="GondolaHill-04.jpg" alt="GondolaHill" %}


At the evening we started walking around and it felt really good. Local people were adamont about hire a pony or ATV. But we were determined to walk. It was really nice to walk. Next morning, our driver took us to a shive temple. It was at the end of the valley. The view of valley from the temple was awesome.

### Day 5: Pahelgam

On day five, we moved to Pahelgam, which is situated oposite of gulmarg. It took almost 5 hours to reach there, we stopped once to buy some walnut. We were pretty hungry when we reach Pahelgam. So, we ate first.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Pahel-01.jpg" alt="Pahelgam" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Pahel-02.jpg" alt="Pahelgam" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Pahel-03.jpg" alt="Pahelgam" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Pahel-04.jpg" alt="Pahelgam" %}

After having lunch at pahelgam, we went to see baisaran valley (or mini switzerland). There is no road to the baisaran valley (actually the road is under construction). The only way is to go to baisaran valley is by pony or walking. Distance is pretty low, hardly one KM. But, it was pretty stiff. Once have to climb 300mtr to reach the baisaran valley. We walked there. It took us around 40minutes. However, if you walk there, people would taunt you. But believe me it is really simple if you ever done any kind of trekking.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Baisaran-01.jpg" alt="Baisaran Valley" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Baisaran-02.jpg" alt="Baisaran Valley" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Baisaran-03.jpg" alt="Baisaran Valley" %}

Baisaran valley was nice. It is pretty big and fenched. You seat there for sometime or do local activities. However, I don't like this very much as it felt artificial. Don't get me wrong, the hills are real. But the valley specifically cleaned and mainatained for tourist. Anyway, it is worth going there once for sure. We stayed there for half an hour. When came down, it was evening and getting dark.

Our driver then took us to the hotel. It was okay hotel. Nothing special about the hotel at all. Anyway, next day we checkout and went for two other attactions, Aru valley and Betaab valley. While both of them were good, they were artificial like Baisaran valley. I have to say that I didn't like much.

### Day 6: Dal Lake

After local valleys, we returned to Srinagar for our final adventure, a night at infamouse house boat. On our way, we visited a apple garden and buy some apple from them. The view was awesome, however, those apples weren't that good. I mean, we can buy better apple from our market. However, it was fresh.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Apple-01.jpg" alt="We stopped at a apple garden" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Dal-01.jpg" alt="Dal lake from sikara" %}

After reaching srinagar, we had one hour of sikara ride prebooked. So, we rode the Dal Lake. It was the best thing about the Dal Lake. Just the ride. Nothing else.

### Return

Next morning, we started very early as our flight was scheduled for early Morning. Overall Kashmir was a sweet experience with some bitter shock. I would try not to go back there again. It like the Sikkim better. I have to go there once again sometime. I am kind of missing the Sikkim.
