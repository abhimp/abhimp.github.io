The [Kashmir][kashmirwiki] is one the most popular tourist destination in India. It is situated in the [Uninon Territory of Jammu and Kashmir][utjk]

I went there after my Dubai Summit along with my parents and my sister. The trip starts from Srinagar and ends with Srinagar. We reached Srinagar pretty late on 29th September. We booked a packaged tour for our trip. So, our driver was waiting at Srinagar Airport for us and he directly took us to the hotel. We stayed srinagar for 4days. Our day 1 starts from 30th September.

### Day 1: Local sight seeing at Srinagar

We started the Day 1 visiting [Shankaracharya Temple][temple]. Our driver took us to the temple base and we had to climb approximately 250 stair cases. It is a typical hindu temple on a hill top. The environment have the desired piousness. Apartfrom this, one can get a great view of Srinagar from this place. I also got fantastic view of the [Jhelum River][jhriver] and the [Dal Lake][dallake]. However, could not capture the best view due to fog.

The Srinagar city also called city of gardens as it have many beautiful gardens. We visited few of them namely [Parimahal][parimahal], [Chashma Shahi Garden][chashmashahi], [Shalimar Bagh Mughal Garden][shalimargarden] and [Nishat Garden][nishatgarden].

Parimahal is multi-level garden on a mountain slope. The entire garden is filled with followers.
