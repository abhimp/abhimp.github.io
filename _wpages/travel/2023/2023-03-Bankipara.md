## Bankipara

Bankipara dam is a river dam at the Dumka district of Jharkhand. It close to my home town. I just wanted to visit the place for apparently no reason. On the very day I could not find any one to accompany me, so, I drive tere alone. It took 1 hour to reach there.

I visited the place during a very good season. It was spring and it was time to Palash flower to bloom. The valley beside the dam was full of Palash tree.
