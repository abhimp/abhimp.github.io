## Bankipara

Bankipara Dam is a river dam in the Dumka district of Jharkhand. It is close to my home town. I just wanted to visit the place for apparently no reason. On that very day, I could not find anyone to accompany me, so, I drove there alone. It took 1 hour to reach there.

I visited the place during a very good season. It was spring and it was time for the Palash flower to bloom. The valley beside the dam was full of Palash trees.

It is better to check out photos than write them.
