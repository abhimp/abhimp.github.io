## Darjeeling
02-Feb-2023 -- 04-Feb-2023

After our [Sandakfu Trek]({% include function_finlink.html plink="2023-01-Sandakfu" %}) we went to [Darjeeling][darj-wiki] as it is one of the most famous tourist spots in the West Bengal. It is a hill station and full of heritage. I wanted to go to Darjeeling primarily to visit the infamous Darjeeling Mall and the [Darjeeling Himalayan Railway][dhr]'s toy train hauled by a [Steam Engine][steam-engin]. So we spend only one day at the Darjeeling.

We reach Darjeeling from Shepi via local shuttle and it was really nice. After reaching Darjeeling it was a bit difficult to find a hotel to stay primarily because our legs were hurting a lot during walking downhill. However, we found a decent enough hotel soon. We needed the well deserved bath so we had it as soon as possible. As time was running out, we went to the station to get on the last Steam Engine hauled train. Luckly we got the ticket with some discount. The lunch for the day needed to be short as didn't had much time. So, the next thing was the **JOY RIDE**.

### The Joy Ride

The Joy Ride started at the Darjeeling Station. I can not just explain how excited we were. The first thing to mention is the whistle. It so natuaral than other train. Let look at the train when it entered the station.

The train went run till the [Batasia Loop][batasia]. Then it stopped there for 15 minute. Other tourist were standing there to take a look of the train and take photos of it and with it. I took some photos and videos as well.
