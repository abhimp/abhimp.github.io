The [Topchanchi Lake](topchanchi) is an old reservoir situated near Dhanbad city. The reservoir was initiated in the year 1926. It is a large water reservoir with breathtaking views.

We visited early in the morning and found it almost empty upon our arrival. We observed the old dam-like structure and ventured closer. It was quite impressive; the dam was constructed of stone and primarily consisted of a few floodgates. From its appearance, one can infer that the dam was built primarily for water storage, indicating that the area receives minimal rainfall. The place was stunning, offering a clear view of Pareshnath Hill.
