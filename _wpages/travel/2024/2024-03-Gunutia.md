Gunutia Nil Kuthi is one of the largest Nil Kuthis in undivided Bengal. While it is situated near my native home, I know very little about it. I always wanted to visit it but never got the time. So, I went there this summer and it was awesome.

Most of the buildings are damaged beyond repair. It is still a private property, and the owner has no interest in preserving any of the fields.

While most of the structures are broken, structures like the fireplace and latrine are still recognizable.
