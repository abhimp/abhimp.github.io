# Egypt
08-September-2024

---

### Sharm-El-Sheikh

This year, my company [VDX.TV][vdxtv] decided to hold our semi-annual engineering summit at the Grand Rotana Hotel in [Sharm-El-Sheikh][sharm], [Egypt][egypt]. It is located on the shore of the [Red Sea][redsea], about 500 kilometers from [Cairo][cairo].

The hotel is situated on the east coast, making the sunrise spectacular. There was a small hill on the other side, which made the sunrise even more beautiful.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Rotana/Sunrise-04.jpg" alt="The sunrise at Rotana Grand Hotel" %}

The hotel was amazing. Its private beach had incredible [coral][coral] formations—the best I have seen in [Egypt][egypt].

The official meetings were held from Monday, the 9th, to Sunday, the 13th. It was a packed schedule, but it wasn’t too boring. I spent most of my free time talking with others and had a great time during the summit.

## Egypt Trip
14-September-2024 -- 20th-September-2024

Once the summit was over, I decided to extend my trip to visit the ruins of ancient Egypt. However, my trip started with a boat ride to a coral reef for snorkeling and diving. I call it Day -1 (minus one), as it was arranged by my office.


### Day -1

The destination for the boat trip was about two hours away by boat. The place was filled with boats, resembling a floating village.


{% include function_travelimg.html img="Boat/BoatVillage-02.jpg" alt="Boats are going to the location" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Boat/BoatVillage-01.jpg" alt="Boats are gathered in the location" %}

We did scuba diving and snorkeling, followed by lunch. Snorkeling was a bit difficult as the gear was mostly defective. However, I still enjoyed the experience.

After lunch, the boat took us to another snorkeling spot. This second location was amazing, with plenty of colorful fish and corals.

<!-- {% include function_travelimg.html img="Boat/Boat-01.jpg" alt="Boats heading to the location" %} -->

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Boat/Boat-05.jpg" alt="Returning to the port" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Boat/Boat-06.jpg" alt="The port" %}

At the end of the day, we visited the local town. The entire town is like a mall, with all kinds of shops and stores.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Boat/Market-01.jpg" alt="A restaurant in the old market at Sharm-el-sheikh" %}

### Day 0

Our flight to [Cairo][cairo] was scheduled for the night of the next day (Sunday, 15th September), so we had a free day. We booked a package trip to the famous [Blue Hole][bluehole] in [Dahab][dahab]. The package included short ATV rides, a camel ride, snorkeling at the [Blue Hole][bluehole] (snorkeling gear was extra), and a visit to the [Coloured Canyon][colorconyon].

I enjoyed both the ATV and camel rides.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Dahab/ATV-01.jpg" alt="ATVs lined up for the adventure ahead" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Dahab/ATV-02.jpg" alt="I’m ready for the adventure ahead" %}
<!-- {% include function_travelimg.html img="Dahab/ATV-360-01.jpg" alt="ATVs lined up for the adventure ahead" is360="true" %} -->

However, the [Blue Hole][bluehole] was a bit of a disappointment. I didn’t snorkel, as there weren’t many corals to see. While the hole itself was prominent, it wasn’t as impressive as we had imagined. Since me and few others didn’t go snorkeling, our guide took us to a higher vantage point where we could take fantastic photos.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Dahab/Corals-01.jpg" alt="Some corals underwater, with sunlight reflections like diamonds" %}

After the visit to the [Blue Hole][bluehole], we headed to the [Coloured Canyon][colorconyon]. I’m not sure about its history, but the canyon was an incredible sight. Although it was very hot, I wished we could have spent more time there. I did manage to take plenty of beautiful photos.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Dahab/Canyon-09.jpg" alt="End of our trip through the Coloured Canyon" %}

After the trip, we returned to the hotel. I had already checked out in the morning, so I took a shower at the gym and had a quick dinner before we headed to the airport for our flight to [Cairo][cairo].

### Day 1
We hired a trip planner, **Mr. Omar (+201005433269)**, from [Luxor][luxor]. He arranged our entire trip, from airport pickup to airport drop-off. However, he did not arrange the hotel for Sunday night, so we booked a hotel in [Giza][giza], assuming we would visit the [Pyramids][pyramid] first. However, our guide had other plans, and we went to the [Egyptian Museum][egyptianmuseum] instead.

#### Egyptian Museum
The [Museum of Egyptian Antiquities][egyptianmuseum], or [Egyptian Museum][egyptianmuseum], is the oldest museum in [Egypt][egypt]. A true Egyptian tour begins with a visit to the [Egyptian Museum][egyptianmuseum].

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Museum-01.jpg" alt="The museum entrance" %}

The museum is filled with ancient Egyptian artifacts like stone and wooden sculptures, [sarcophagi][sarcophagus], [Sphinxes][sphynx], wall art, scripts, papyri, and much more. It didn’t make sense to capture too many pictures since most of them are readily available on the internet. So, I took minimal photos and enjoyed the tour. While most parts of the museum allow photography, the room with the [Funerary Golden Mask of King Tutankhamun][maskoftutenkhamen] has a strict no-photo policy. I accidentally took a picture there, and they politely asked me to delete it. Overall, the trip to the museum was fantastic.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Museum-04.jpg" alt="A stone sarcophagus" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Museum-05.jpg" alt="A Sphinx" %}


### The Perfume Shop, Hibiscus Tea, and Koshari

After visiting the [Egyptian Museum][egyptianmuseum], our guide took us to a perfume shop to store our luggage. Since we hadn’t had breakfast yet, they also arranged it for us.

In Egyptian tradition, they offer a welcome drink—either coffee, [Hibiscus tea][hibiscustea], or a cold drink. The perfume shop followed this tradition. This was the first time I had [Hibiscus tea][hibiscustea], and I loved it.

They also served us [Koshari][koshari] for breakfast (we paid for it), which is a staple food in Egypt. It was really tasty, but it was far more than we could manage for breakfast, so we were full for the rest of the day.

Since it was a perfume shop, they gave us a demonstration of their perfumes. However, the perfumes were extremely expensive, so we politely declined and left for the [Pyramids][pyramid].

#### Pyramids and Sphinx

The [Pyramids][pyramid] and the [Sphinx][sphynx] are the most iconic artifacts to visit in [Egypt][egypt]. Until now, I had only seen them in pictures, but in reality, they were just as magnificent as I had imagined. The pyramids are built on a high plateau, far above the [Nile]'s water level. The large pyramid consists of millions of individual stones, each likely weighing several tons. The sheer size of these stones is mind-blowing.

**Pyramids**


{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Pyramid-01.jpg" alt="Pyramids" %}

---
---


The [Pyramids][pyramid] are basically tomb for faraos and kings. However, they never share a pyramid with others. So, they build two other smaller tomb for their wife(s) and daughter(s). So, there are a total of nine pyramids. However, smaller pyramids are almost gone. Faraos has also builds tombs near the [Pyramids][pyramid]. These weren't Pyramids, so they just ruins.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Pyramid-02.jpg" alt="Pyramids" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Pyramid-03.jpg" alt="The Great Pyramid of Giza" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Me-01.jpg" alt="Me in front of the Great Pyramid of Giza" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Pyramid-04.jpg" alt="They built the Pyramid stone by stone" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Me-02.jpg" alt="Me in front of the Great Pyramid of Giza" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Pyramid-05.jpg" alt="The medium Pyramid" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Pyramid-06.jpg" alt="The small Pyramid" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Pyramid-07.jpg" alt="The medium Pyramid, view from the small Pyramid" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Pyramid-08.jpg" alt="Pyramids" %}

As all the [Pyramids][pyramid] are tomb, there are ways to go inside the tomb. Our guide told us not to go inside the great pyramid of [Giza][giza], rather go inside the small pyramid. We took his advise. The experience was awesome. We had to go down through a narrow corridor where we can barely stand. The tomb was placed in depth. While the experience was fantastics, it was very suffocating.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/InPyramid-01.jpg" alt="The narrow tunnel to the tomb inside the Pyramid" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/InPyramid-02.jpg" alt="The path to inside the Pyramid to the tomb" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/InPyramid-03.jpg" alt="The final stair to the tomb" %}

**Sphynx**

Our next destination was the the [Great Sphynx of Giza][greatsphynx]. A [Sphynx][sphynx] is a mythical creature one can read about in the wikipedia.

Our first view of the [Great Sphynx of Giza][greatsphynx] was from the road from the pyramids to the sphynx. The [Great Sphynx of Giza][greatsphynx] is the largest [Sphynx][sphynx] ever found. It is still there in its original location near the pyramids and very close to the river [Nile]. As per out guide, River [Nile] used to come upto the front feet of the Sphynx.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Sphynx-01.jpg" alt="Two large pyramids and the greate sphynx" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Sphynx-02.jpg" alt="Three pyramids and the greate sphynx" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Sphynx-03.jpg" alt="Two large pyramids and the greate sphynx" %}

Now a days, the way to the [Great Sphynx of Giza][greatsphynx] is through the Inn. [Sphynx][sphynx] are solid and threre no way to go inside.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Sphynx-04.jpg" alt="The way to the great Sphynx" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Sphynx-05.jpg" alt="The great Sphynx of Giza" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Me-03.jpg" alt="Tiny me beside the great Sphynx" %}

Our trip at [Giza][giza] ends here. We headed towards Bus stop as we took Bus from [Cairo][cairo] to [Luxor][luxor].

#### The bus journey to Luxor

It was a 9:30 hrs journey in a marcedes benz luxory bus. We started at 5:30 pm and reached by 3am. The bus stopped multiple times for food and toilet.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day1/Bus-01.jpg" alt="The bus to the Luxor" %}

### Day 2: Luxor

We reached luxor 1hr eariler than we anticipated at 3:00 am. So, tour giude put us at our cruise for freshen up and rest. However, it was very short as we had to start for the our next adventure around 5am morning.

#### Hot Air Baloon Ride

Our next adventure was to watch Sun rise from a Hot Air Baloon. So, the baloon ride started when sun is about to rise.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon_Banner-01.jpg" alt="Hot Air Baloon" %}

As the name suggest, it is Hot Air Baloon. A huge baloon filled with Hot Air which lift people up in the air. It is very hard to imagine the size of the baloon even after seeing it with my own eyes. It needed well coordinated help from lots people to Inflate the baloon.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-00.jpg" alt="The baloon crews are preparing the baloon to inflate" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-01.jpg" alt="Initially baloon needs to be inflated by blowing cold air" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-02.jpg" alt="Finally hot air would lift the baloon along with the busket" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-03.jpg" alt="Baloons are ready to take of" %}

Once baloons are inflated and and buskets are up, it is time to hope into the busket and enjoy the ride.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-05.jpg" alt="Some baloons are started ascending" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-04.jpg" alt="We are started ascending" %}

Initially it was a bumpy ride, but pretty soon we are high in sky and nothing from ground can stop our movements.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-06.jpg" alt="We are ascending" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-07.jpg" alt="We are pretty high" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-08.jpg" alt="We can look below and see things other than ground" %}

Slowly we gained enough altitude to see the other side of the [Nile] where Sun is about to rise. It was beautiful to see that the Sun is rising from the hill.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-09.jpg" alt="The sun is about to rise" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-10.jpg" alt="We can take a peek of sun" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-11.jpg" alt="Sun is risen" %}

Sun rise is over. It is time to glide and find a suitable spot to land. While the baloon is manueverable, it nither easy nor precise. A little wind can destroy several minutes of course correction. So, we gild over the corps to find suitable spot while avoiding the high voltage eletric wires. However this were captains tensions. We were enjoying view as long as possible.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-12.jpg" alt="We are gliding over the field with many other baloons" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-13.jpg" alt="We can see the clear line between green and rocks" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-14.jpg" alt="We closer to the Nile and far from the rocks" %}

Finally we found the a suitable spot and came down. However, precise spot is being selected by the ground crew. They pulled the baloon while we were floating few feet above the ground. Then landed softly in the choosen spot.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-15.jpg" alt="Ground crews are pulling the baloon" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Baloon-16.jpg" alt="They are busy packing the huge (still hot) baloon" %}


Our baloon ride finally came to a end. However, we were still excited from the experience.

After baloon ride, we were to go to the [Valley of the Kings][valleyofkings]. However, we haven't had breakfast yet. So, our guide arranges sandwitch with local hand made bread for us.

#### Valley of the Kings

We headed for the [Valley of the Kings][valleyofkings]. It is a valley with under ground tombs of Kings and Faraos. This tombs are more recent than the [Pyramids][pyramid] in the [Giza][giza].

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Kings-01.jpg" alt="The 3d map of the valley including the under ground tombs" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Kings-02.jpg" alt="Entrance to the valley" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Kings-03.jpg" alt="The valley" %}

As treasure beside mummies were getting stolen from [Pyramid][pyramid], the kings decided to hide there mummies and treasures for the afterlife. The ancient egyptian have curved out the lime stone of hills to make these tombs.

I think we have found a total of 34 tombs till now. However, currently only 9 tombs are open for public. The entrance ticket is good for visiting any 3 three tombs. However, we cheated and visited tombs 2, 6, 8, 11. The tombs are filled with painting and sculpture. It is meaningless to even try to capture them while being a tourist only. However, I have took few photos.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Kings-04.jpg" alt="Wall painting at one of the tombs" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Kings-09.jpg" alt="Wall painting at one of the tombs" %}

#### Karnak village

After the [Valley of Kings][valleyofkings], our guide took us to Karnak village where they were making items out of albaster stone. We were able to reduce the price to 10% of what they asked.

#### Karnak Temple

Our next destination for the was [Karnak Temple][karnaktemple]. It is situated at the heart of the city of [Luxor][luxor]. The original temple was massive and build on top of huge area. It also has a direct connection with the river [Nile][nile]. Currently only few parts of the original temple is available to visit.

The entrance of the temple has several [Sphynx][sphynx] on the both side. However, most of them are destroyed.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Karnak-00.jpg" alt="The Karnak temple: Entrance" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Karnak-01.jpg" alt="The Karnak temple: Entrance" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Karnak-04.jpg" alt="The Karnak temple" %}

After the entrance it has a open area. Here we have multiple pillers standing about 10mtr high and 2mtr widths. Like all other temple, all the walls are full of painting and carving. It also has two obelix standing there.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Karnak-03.jpg" alt="The Karnak temple" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Karnak-05.jpg" alt="The Karnak temple" %}

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Karnak-08.jpg" alt="The Karnak temple" %}

We exited from [Karnak Temple][karnaktemple] around 1PM. We had to pay Mr. Omar for our trip and catch the cruise. We did not visit the [Luxor Temple][luxortemple]. I got few photos from the car but not very good.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Luxor-01.jpg" alt="The Luxor temple from the road" %}


#### Experience on Cruise

Although, we checked in in the cruise at 3:40 am in the morning. However, we were their just for and hour before we went away for hot air baloon ride.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Cruise-01.jpg" alt="The dock where our cruise were docked at the morning" %}

After visiting [Karnak Temple][karnaktemple], we rushed to cruise. It was almost lunch time at the cruise. We were also very tired. So, had our lunch and went for nap. Lunch was really awesome with lot of different salad, vegetables and deserts.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Cruise-02.jpg" alt="Our room in the cruise were awesome and cozy" %}

I awaked after few hours of nap. When I looked through the window, I find some local people trying sell sarees though the window.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Cruise-03.jpg" alt="Local sellers are coming near the cruise" %}

At the afternoon, I awaked up and found that our ship is about to cross a dam. So, run to the sundeck. The dam was small. However, it needed same manuever as panama canal gate. I has only 1 stage though. So, it was an interesting surprize.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/LockGate-01.jpg" alt="Our cruise have to rise up before it can go throught the lock" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/LockGate-02.jpg" alt="Water level at the both side equalise. The gate is about to open." %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/LockGate-02.jpg" alt="Anothe dam crossing" %}

At the evening, Sunset from the dock was awesome. Here goes some photos:

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/CruiseSunset-01.jpg" alt="Sunset from the cruise" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/CruiseSunset-02.jpg" alt="Sunset from the cruise" %}

There was another suprise waiting for us at the evening. They throw a free cocktail party. It was well decorated and nice separation between alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails. However, they looks exactly same.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Cruise-04.jpg" alt="Cocktail Party" %}

The deck was even prettier in the night.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Cruise-05.jpg" alt="The Swiming pool" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Cruise-06.jpg" alt="Rest of the Deck" %}

And it was a full moon.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Moon-01.jpg" alt="Full Moon" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day2/Moon-02.jpg" alt="Full Moon" %}

We reached [Edfu] town around 10:30 pm and docked here for the night.

---

### Day 3: Edfu & Kom Ombo

On the Wednesday morning we got an awake up call from the ship. After having breakfast at the ship, went out. Our tour was waiting there already. He took us to the Edfu temple using horse pulled cart.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day3/HorseCart-01.jpg" alt="The horse pulled cart" %}

The town itself is very simple and ordinary town. It is very similar to Indian towns. In fact, they have Indian [Auto Rickshaw] for public transport. These are imported from India.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day3/TheEdfuTown-01.jpg" alt="The Edfu town out side the temple" %}

#### Edfu Temple
The [Temple of Edfu] is the second largest temple in the Egypt after Karnak temple. It is the best preserved temple so far. It also placed at West side of the river [Nile], which is weird as acient egyptians believed that the west side of the [Nile] river is the land of deatch. However, this particular temple was built by the [Greeks] after they have occupied the [Egypt][egypt].

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day3/EdfuTemple-01.jpg" alt="Main entrance to the temple of Edfu" %}

The [Temple of Edfu] temple is temple of revenge and victory. Basically, God [Horus] take revenge for her mother [Isis] with [Set]. The story is interesting and it more interesting with the wall patings. The entire temple is about symbolism same as everything else in the ancient egypt.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day3/EdfuTemple-07.jpg" alt="The painting for story telling" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day3/EdfuTemple-08.jpg" alt="The painting for story telling" %}

The temple was built by 10 different kings from [Ptolemy III Euergetes][ptolemni3] to [Ptolemy XII Auletes][ptolemi12]. The outside paintings and curvings are about the King 12 King.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day3/EdfuTemple-03.jpg" alt="The culpture of horus. This is the intact one" %}

The temple starts with common ground where general people cloud present their offiering to the god. It sorrounded by three wall and the entrance to the holy part of the temple. The three wall also have 32 stone pillers just like Katnak temple. This 32 pillers represent 30 priest, high priest and the king.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day3/EdfuTemple-09.jpg" alt="One side of the common ground" %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day3/EdfuTemple-02.jpg" alt="Inner entrance to the temple of Edfu. Reserved for the previlleged" %}

The holy part of the temple is primarily made of pillers with very tall cellings. At the end of the holy part there is a sacred area where horas lived. High priest or the king would present there offering to the god thrice every day. They would not show there back to god, so they would walk backward while comming back.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day3/EdfuTemple-05.jpg" alt="The inner hall." %}
{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day3/EdfuTemple-04.jpg" alt="The inner most chamber. Only the king and the high priest was allowed here." %}

I enjoyed this temple most. The guide was awesome and very knowledgable. He told us the myth story which some what matches with the movie [Gods of Egypt].

#### A new member at our room
After the visit to the [Temple of Edfu], we got back to the ship. When we entered the ship, there a surprse waiting for us.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day3/Ship-01.jpg" alt="The surprise at room" %}


#### Kom Ombo Temple

Our day 4 started very early as we checkout of the cruise at 4 am in the morning and started for the [Temple of Abu Simbel][Abu Simbel] which is about 200KM south to the [Aswan].

#### Abu Simbel

The [Abu Simbel] temple is situated beside the [Lake Nasser]. [Lake Nasser] becomes a lake when they build the [Aswan High Dam] on the river [Nile]. Basically, the [Aswan High Dam] created a 500km long lake. [Lake Nasser] is a part of it.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day4/AbuSimbel-08.jpg" alt="Inside the great temple of Abu Simbel" %}

The original temple was well bellow the current water level at lake nasser. So, unesco move the entire temple to high land. Unesco actually saved several such temples by moving them to different places.

We finishes our tour at [Abu Simbel] little early. After [Abu Simbel], went to [Temple of Philae].

#### Temple of Philae

The [Temple of Philae] is situated just beside the [Aswan Low Dam] on a island. So, one needs to take a ferry to reach the temple.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day4/Philae-01.jpg" alt="View of the temple of philae from ferry" %}

It is another temple that was submerge in the water after 1st dam was buit. They moved the entire temple stone-by-stone to a high ground. Although they did a great job, it is not perfect as the choosen high ground is smaller than the original one. So, they had to squize the temple and they did a pretty bad job as wall in front of another wall.

#### New Fake Nubian Village
Nubian were lived south the old dam. However, they had to moved to north of it as original village got flooded. Now a the entire village is dependent on tourism. They also pet crocodile as an exbition.

Everyone in my group loved this village. They also pet the crocodile to take photo. However, I hate this place. Every thing about this village is fake and have only one purpose that is to milk the tourist. Every bricks, designs, streets are their for lure tourist. It is like a market not a village.

I also don't like the idea of petting crocodile. They are not really petting them. That is a show piece for tourist. Villagers kept those crocodile in extremely confined space where they can't ever strech. When they give the crocodile to a tourist, they tie its jaws so that it can't bite. It was so cruel. I didn't pet it.

#### Aswan

After that Nubian village, we went to a restaurant near to Aswan railway station. We kept our bags there and went to local market after having some lunch.

#### The sleeping train

We reached station almost 45 min before the time. The train was there. So, we boarded the train.

The train is a big disappointment. The cabin is really really small for the price. Also, it is way below the standard. I mean 3 tier AC train in India is way better than this.

While the train was really dirty and they did not provided any towel, bed was clean and we slept very well. Next morning we awake pretty late and started preparing our self to deboarding at El-giza Station. Train was running on time.

### Day 5

We reached to [Cairo][cairo] on time. We deboarded at El-Giza Station. Like everywhere, our guide was ready at the station with car. After freshen up a bit, we started our site-seeing.

#### Museum of Civilization

Our first destination was to the [Musée de la civilisation], otherwise known as [Museum of Civilizations][Musée de la civilisation]. It is a newly build museum. It show case the evolution of the the Egyptian Civilization starting from about thrity five thousand BC. However, the speciality of the this museum the collection of mummies.

The [Musée de la civilisation] has a vast collection of mummies and they have categorically arranged them as per the time line. While the experience is awesome, no photography is allowed inside this place.

#### Cairo Citadel

Our next destination was to the [Cairo Citadel] or Citadel of Saladin. It is relative modern. It is mostly a administrative building. It has a large Mosque. I took several photos.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Day5/Citadel-09.jpg" alt="Cairo Citadel" %}

Our trip ends here. However we went to local market to buy some dates and having our lunch. After we were roaming around and saw this.
