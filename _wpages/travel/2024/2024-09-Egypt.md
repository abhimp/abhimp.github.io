## Egypt Trip
14-September-2024 -- 

Last day of our official work was on 13th September. We started our trip on 14th, however it was planned by office only.

### Day -2
We went on a boat trip for scooba diving and snorkelling. It was about 2hr boat journey to a diving and snorkelling spot. A lot of other boats also went there. It was looking like a floating village for some time.

We performed scooba diving and snorkelling followed by our lunch there.

They boat took us to a another spot for snorkelling. The second place was awesome snorkelling as it has many color full fishes and corals.

At end of the day, we visited local market.

### Day -1
We had no official plans for the last day at the Sharm-El-Sharm and our plane was at the night. So, we booked a package deal for Dahab. It was a deal for ATV ride, Camel ride, blue hole visit and visit the canyon. The trip was nice. Mostly okay. However, the blue hole was over hyped.

### Day 1

#### Egyptian Museum
Our real egypt trip started on 16th Sept. Although we booked our hotel at giza, tour guide took us to Egyptian Museume first. We saw sculptures, wall arts, mummies and learn lot about egypt here. It was really good

After museum of egypt we visited a local perfume shop and we had our breakfast here. They were trying to sell expensive perfume but we did not buzz.

#### Pyramid and Sphynx
After this we finally started for the great pyramid of egypt. Our tour guide arranged the ticket for the pyramid premises, however we had to buy ticket to enter the pyramid. He also suggested not to go inside the large pyramid. Instead, he asked us to go inside the smallest one. It was a good advise as it is suffocating inside.

The place have three prominent pyramids for three faraos. Six (two for each faraos) more smaller, almost destroyed pyramids are their. We didnot go there. But we can see them all.

Our first destination was at the -big pyramid-. We just took few photos, climed a bit and thats all. It is hard to believe that this pyramids are man made. Each pieces of stones are so big that *xxx*. We climbed upto the entrance and came down.

We went to the smallest pyramid premises and enter the pyramid. It was narrow slippery tunnel with no vetilention. However, it was amazing and we would have missed a important thing if we would not have gone there.

After pyramids, we went to see phinx. It is 

### The bus journey to Luxor

We took bus to luxor from cairo. It was a 9:30 hrs journey in a marcedes benz luxory bus. We started at 5:30 pm and reached by 3am. The bus stopped multiple times for food and toilet.

### Day 2: Luxor

We reached luxor 1hr eariler than we anticipated at 3:00 am. So, tour giude put us at our cruise for freshen up and rest.

We went for hot air baloon before sunrise arround 5am.

#### Hot Air Baloon Ride

Baloon ride started when sun is about to rise. It was a huge coordination ammong lot of people. First they started blowing cold air to inflate the baloon followed by hot air. As baloon started ascending, we hopped into the basket.

As we ascended, we were mesmorised by the view of horizon filled with baloons. The sun risen behind the Nile river little after we ascended to a level.

We started desending after some time (about 20 minute). However it was pretty long process and involved lot of crews.

#### Kings valley

Our next destination is the Kings Valley. It is a valley with under ground tombs of Kings and Faraos.

Ancient egyptian have curved out the lime stone to hills to make this tombs.

There are several tombs. However one ticket allows only 3 tomb visits. I cheated a bit and visited 2 6 8 11. 8 was the deepest. 11 had most intact painting. 

#### Karnak village

Guide took us to Karnak village where they were making items out of albaster stone. We were able to reduce the price to 10% of what they asked.

#### Karnak Temple
Karnak Temple is situated at Luxor. It is built on top a huge area. I contains large numbers of stone piller. Each of the pillers heights is about 10Mtr and diameter is about 2mtr. It also contains several stone culptures of faraos and different annimals they worshipped. I have 2 complete obelix and a half obelix.

#### Experience on Cruise
We checked in in the cruise at 3:40 am in the morning. However, we were their just for and hour before we went away for hot air baloon ride.

We really checked in at our cruise at 1pm only. We were very tired at that time. So, had our lunch and went for nap. Lunch was really awesome with lot of different salad, vegetables and deserts.

At the evening, I awaked up and found that our ship is about to cross a dam. So, I just put on something and run to the sundeck. The dam was small. However, it needed same manuever as panama canal gate. I has only 1 stage though. So, it was an interesting surprize.

There was another suprise waiting for us at the evening. They throw a free cocktail party. It was well decorated and nice separation between alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails. However, they looks exactly same.

We reached Edfu town around 10:30 pm and docked here for the night.

### Day 3: Edfu

On the Wednesday morning we got an awake up call from the ship. After having breakfast at the ship, went out. Our tour was waiting there already. He took us to the Edfu temple using horse pulled cart.

The town itself is very simple and ordinary temple. It is very similar to Indian towns.

#### Edfu Temple
Edfu temple is the second largest temple in the Egypt after Karnak temple. It is the best preserved temple so far. 

Edfu temple is temple of revenge and victory. Basically, God horas take revenge for her mother XXX with Seith. The story is interesting and it more interesting with the wall patings. The entire temple is about symbolism same as everything else in the ancient egypt.

The temple was built by 11 different kings from XXX 2 to XXX 12. The outside paintings and curvings are about the King 12 King.

The temple starts with common ground where general people cloud present their offiering to the god. It sorrounded by three wall and the entrance to the holypart of the temple. The three wall also have 32 stone pillers just like Katnak temple. This 32 pillers represent 30 priest, high priest and the king.

The holy part of the temple is primarily made of pillers with very tall cellings. At the end of the holy part there is a sacred area where horas lived. High priest or the king would present there offering to the god thrice every day. They would not show there back to god, so they would walk backward while comming back.

#### Kom Ombo Temple
Kom ombo Temple is the temple of two god. It is very near to the nile. In fact one of the entrance gate piller fall into to the nile due erosion.

### Day 4
Our day 4 started very early as we checkout of the cruise at 4 am in the morning and started for Abu Simbel Temple which is about 200KM south to the Aswan.

#### Abu Simbel

Abu Simbel temple is situated beside lake nasser. Lake nasser becomes a lake when they build the high dam on river nile. Basically, the high dam created a 500km long lake. Lake nasser is a part of it.

The temple was curved out of hill by cutting out all the stones. The original temple was well bellow the current water level at lake nasser. So, unesco move the entire temple to high land. Unesco actually saved several such temples by moving them to different places.
