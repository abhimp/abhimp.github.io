It is a trip to [Joychandi Pahar][joychandi] while exploring the beauty of spring in [Purulia][purulia].

On the way, we start from Durgapur station towards Koro Pahar. However, it turns out to be a small bump in the landscape and not very interesting. With huge disappointment, we move towards Joychandi Pahar. The map told us that there is a small dam named [Gangdua Dam][gangduadam] (check photos for GPS location). It is a really small dam. I am unsure of its purpose. However, it is a nice place for a walk. Here are some photos.

After Gangdua, we head for Joychandi Pahar without any further detours. However, we did enjoy the Flower Fire throughout the journey. It was awesome.

Finally, we reached Joychandi Pahar. While there are three hills, we climbed only one and stayed there as long as we could. It was a very small trek. We could see the landscape all around us with such clarity.
