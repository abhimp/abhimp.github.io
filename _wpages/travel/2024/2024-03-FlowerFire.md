It is trip to [Joychandi pahar][joychandi] while exploring the beauty of spring in the [Purulia][purulia].

On the we start from the Durgapur station towards Koro Pahar. However, it turns out to be a small bump in the landscape and not much interesting. With a huge disappointment, we move towards Joychandi pahar. However, map told us that there is a small dam name [Gangdua Dam][gangduadam] (check photos for GPS location). It is really small dam. I am sure of the purpose. However, it is a nice place to walk sometime. Here goes some photos.

After Gangdua we head for the Joychandi pahar without any further detour. However, we did enjoy the Flower Fire throughout the journey. It was awesome.

Finally we reached Joychandi pahar. While there are three hills, we climbed only one and stayed there as long as we could. It was a very small trek. We could see landscape all around us with such a clarity.
