[Bishnupur] is a historic town in West Bengal, India, famous for its terracotta temples, classical music, and Baluchari sarees. Once the capital of the [Malla kings][Mallabhum_kingdom], it is renowned for its unique architecture and rich cultural heritage.

I went [Bishnupur] multiple times. I always find the place very unique and connected to the history. Last time I visited with Malay. I went Bishnupur from my home place Birbhum and he came from Kharagpur.

We started our tour by visiting famous [Rasmancha]. It is the oldest brick temple (problaly in Bishnupur) and very well preserved. It was built in 1600 CE.

We followed to [Madan Mohan Temple] which is suprisingly very well preserved and still worshipped.

Our next destination was Stone Chariot (পাথরের রথ). This a small temple looks like Chariot dedicated to the lord Bishnu.

Garh Darja is gateway to the Garh or fort. It was pretty close to the Stone Chariot and visible from one place to another. However, There is a Small Stone Gate (ছোট পাথর দরজা) before the big Garh Darja.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Gum_Ghar-01.jpg" alt="Gum Ghar" %}

We visited the famous and well preserved Pancha Ratna Shyam Rai Temple. The temple is filled the Terracotta art work and all of them are readable now. I am saying readable becuase it does describe some stories through the images. The place is extremely crowded most of the time.

While most of the trip ends here and goes to the DalMadal Gun, we took some reroute and visited several least visited but well preserve temples. It is meaningless to describe all of them.
