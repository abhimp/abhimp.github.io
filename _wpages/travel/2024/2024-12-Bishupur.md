[Bishnupur] is a historic town in West Bengal, India, famous for its terracotta temples, classical music, and Baluchari sarees. Once the capital of the [Malla kings][Mallabhum_kingdom], it is renowned for its unique architecture and rich cultural heritage.

I have been to [Bishnupur] multiple times. I always find the place very unique and connected to its history. The last time I visited was with Malay. I traveled to Bishnupur from my hometown in Birbhum, and he came from Kharagpur.

We started our tour by visiting the famous [Rasmancha]. It is the oldest brick temple (probably in Bishnupur) and is very well preserved. It was built in 1600 CE.

We then went to the [Madan Mohan Temple], which is surprisingly well-preserved and still a place of worship.

Our next destination was the Stone Chariot (পাথরের রথ). This is a small temple that looks like a chariot, dedicated to Lord Vishnu.

Garh Darja is the gateway to the Garh, or fort. It was pretty close to the Stone Chariot, and they are visible from one another. However, there is a Small Stone Gate (ছোট পাথর দরজা) before the large Garh Darja.

After visiting Garh Darja, we visited Lalji Temple, followed by Radha Shyam Temple, Jor Bangla Temple, and Gum Ghar.

{% include function_travelimg.html img="Gum_Ghar-01.jpg" alt="Gum Ghar" %}

We visited the famous and well-preserved Pancha Ratna Shyam Rai Temple. The temple is filled with terracotta artwork, and the stories they depict are still discernible today. I say discernible because they describe stories through the images. The place is extremely crowded most of the time.

While most tours end here before heading to the Dal Madal Canon, we took a detour to visit several less-frequented but well-preserved temples. It would be too much to describe all of them.

Finally, we visited the Jor Mandir Temples, where three identical-looking terracotta temples stand in a single complex.
