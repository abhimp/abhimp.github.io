[Bishnupur] is a historic town in West Bengal, India, famous for its terracotta temples, classical music, and Baluchari sarees. Once the capital of the [Malla kings][Mallabhum_kingdom], it is renowned for its unique architecture and rich cultural heritage.

I went [Bishnupur] multiple times. I always find the place very unique and connected to the history. Last time I visited with Malay. I went Bishnupur from my home place Birbhum and he came from Kharagpur.

We started our tour by visiting famous [Rasmancha]. It is the oldest brick temple (problaly in Bishnupur) and very well preserved. It was built in 1600 CE.

We followed to [Madan Mohan Temple] which is suprisingly very well preserved and still worshipped.
