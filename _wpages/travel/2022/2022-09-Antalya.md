### In the way to Istanbul

### Antalya

### Sun Fun Family Club Saphire

We reached there around 5:30pm. I was very much exhuasted. So, quickly took a bath. Instead of going to bed, I went to the beach and be seated there. After sometime I started wonder around the resort and quicky found out that there are multiple restaurant. One of them called main restaurant. I entered there to find a massive buffet of continental food. Initially I had some doubt about the pricing, but could not find any one keeping note of customer. I eat as much as I can and left. Later days, I understand that almost everything inside the resort is inclusive of the room payment, that including the drinks. Here is some photos and videos I took.

### Duden Falls

We went to the Turkie in a business trip, and I totally forgot to extend the trip. To, make a last effort to see something at the Turkie, we planned to visit duden falls, which is close to the Antalya Airport. The entry fee was 10 lira, but it was nice. It remind me the elephants hill at shilong.
