## Massanjore Dam
16-Jul-2022

---

[Massanjore Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massanjore_Dam) is a HydroEletric Power Plant. At least, it used to. I used to know it had a capacity of 12MW. However, today I saw it was 4MW. I am not sure if it is still producing electricity or not, wiki might have better informations. It is near to my home, only 35KM and it pretty nice place. I love to go there every now and then. Today I went with two of my friends with my own car.
