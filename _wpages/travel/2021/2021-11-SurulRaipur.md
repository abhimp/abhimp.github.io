## Surul-Raipur
05-Nov-2021

---

[Surul][1] and [Raipur][3] are a few historical places near Bolpur, Birbhum. 



### Surul

Surul is very close to Bolpur town. I am not aware of the history. However, they have a mansion and a few terracotta temples. The main temple was extremely old and needed some maintenance. Instead of maintaining the terracotta, they decided to put the concrete layer on top of the old structure.

### Raipur

Raipur is about 7 KM from Bolpur town. Raipur has a mansion built by Singh house. It is very old and most of the parts are destroyed due to its age. So, no one lives here. It is still owned by the Singh house, but is currently maintained by local people as it is a heritage and attract tourist.

I find it fascinating to see such a building in a village still staying. It was awesome to be there. Here go a few photos from the place. I really thankful to my friends who took me there. Here go a few photos.
