OpenSSL is one of the greatest opensource tool we have. It is used by many project as it is defacto tool for SSL based solutions.

The best thing about OpenSSL is that it is platform agonastic and ease of use. Writing portable code is so much easier with OpenSSL.

Also OpenSSL support different kind of IOs and very easy adapt a new one if it does exists already.
